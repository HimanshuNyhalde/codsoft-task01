📌 Project Title: Rule-Based Chatbot

📄 Project Description:

This project involves building a **simple rule-based chatbot** using Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users by providing predefined responses to specific user inputs. It uses basic **if-else conditions** and **keyword or phrase matching** to understand and respond to queries.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the **fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP)** without relying on machine learning. It helps in understanding how a chatbot works by mapping user inputs to corresponding responses, simulating a real conversation flow.

🔧 Features:

* Responds to basic greetings like “hello”, “hi”, “hey”.
* Answers simple questions like “What’s your name?”, “How are you?”, and “What’s the weather?”.
* Handles exit commands like “bye” or “exit”.
* Provides fallback responses for unknown inputs.
* Runs entirely in the terminal using Python’s built-in functions.

🧠 Learning Objectives:

* Understand how rule-based logic can simulate a conversation.
* Learn how to capture and process user input.
* Get hands-on experience with string handling and conditional statements in Python.
* Understand the limitations of static response models vs. dynamic AI models.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used:

Python 3.x
No external libraries required

💡 Future Enhancements:

* Integrate pattern matching using Regular Expressions (`re` module).
* Store and manage responses using dictionaries or JSON files.
* Add context awareness or multi-turn conversation capability.
* Develop a simple GUIusing Tkinter or a web-based interface using Flask.
